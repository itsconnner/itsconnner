CMD note
--------

CMD doesn't handle newlines with \n well. This causes CMD to output an extra
newline in the terminal. To avoid this problem, keep an extra empty line at the
end of the source file.


Setup scripts
-------------

All setup scripts must be PowerShell scripts. Script names should have a
two-digit number prefix followed by a hyphen. Scripts are executed in order,
sorted by these numbers.

FIXME
-----
FUCK vcpkg on ARM64 Windows. It refuses to find VC tools like a dumbass,
and I've wasted 4 hours in this flaming pit of misery. I'm absolutely DONE.
