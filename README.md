Here's Jiamu Sun. A Miku fan who started programming in the first year of high
school. IDEs are forbidden. Prefers GNU C over C++. Also comfortable with shell
scripting and low-level programming. Experienced in cross-platform development.
Uses Git fluently — at a level most IDE users probably wouldn't bother with.

and over-engineering.
