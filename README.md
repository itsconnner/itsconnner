                        A brief overview of barroit

Here’s Jiamu Sun, though barroit is preferred. A Miku fan with nearly 3 years
of development experience. IDEs are forbidden. More detailed self-introductions
are bothersome and awkward, so that’s pretty much it.

Currently living in Japan, and languages spoken include

	中文
	English
	日本語

Development experience covers areas such as

	Command-line application
	IoT
	Website
	Minecraft plugin
	Discord bot
	Vocaloid song

The preferred contact email address is barroit@linux.com; however,
sunjiamu@outlook.com is also acceptable.
