Setup Mutt
==========

When using Outlook, setting up the authentication method is not as
straightforward as usual. Microsoft now uses ‘OAuth2/Modern Auth’, so the
regular password does not work.

How to
------

Setup mutt configuration

	make setup-filelink.sh

Go to https://portal.azure.com/ and navigate to ‘App Registrations’. Access the
application (likely mutt). In the app's ‘Overview’ panel, retrieve the
‘Application (client) ID’ and set this as the client_id in ~/.mutt/oauth2info.

Create a GPG key and use the GPG identity as the user_id. For details on
generating a GPG key, refer to the ‘Configure script's token file encryption’
section in contrib/mutt_oauth2.py.README under the mutt repository.

Example ~/.mutt/ouathuser

	client_id xxxx-xxxx-xxxx
	user_id   USER-ID

Generate the token file and place it in ~/.mutt. Note that the filename must
follow the format: imap_user.t

	mutt_oauth2.py ${imap_user}.t --authorize
	mv ${imap_user}.t ~/.mutt
