Build Vim
=========

The bundled vi(vim) does not have the clipboard or other important enhancements
without x libs, we need to build a reliable vim manually.

How to
------

Install dependencies
'sudo apt install libx11-dev libxtst-dev libxt-dev libsm-dev libxpm-dev'

Configure vim "./configure CFLAGS='-g0 -O3'"

Verify the HAVE_X11 is defined 'grep X11 src/auto/config.h'

NOTE
----

If Vim has been built before, distclean the built file 'make distclean'
