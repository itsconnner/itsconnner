Token Setup
-----------

First, set up app registrations. Follow the guide at

	mutt/contrib/mutt_oauth2.py.README


Then, generate a GPG key for token encryption

	gpg --no-greeting --full-generate-key

Don't forget to comment keys with 'mutt'. Otherwise you screw up your keyring.


Once key generated, run this to get token

	~/.mutt/oauth2.py miku@example.com.token --authorize

Some providers need client secret. Skip it, and you're gonna get your ass
kicked.
